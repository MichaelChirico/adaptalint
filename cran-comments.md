## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

- Elaborated on on description text, including saying that in this case, 
    'code style' means which lintr rules are followed and which aren't.
- Removed `dontrun` on examples
- Removed examples on functions dealing with packages - there is no clean way
    of doing it.
- Added two new functions, with examples, dealing with single files


## Test environments
- local elementaryOS 0.4.1 Loki, based on Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS, R 3.4.4, 3.5.0
- local OS X install, R 3.3.2
- ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), (release, devel)
- win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

- This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
