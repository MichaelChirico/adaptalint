Authors@R: c(person("Max", "Conway", email = "conway.max1@gmail.com",
                  role = c("aut", "cre")),
             person("Natasha", "Latysheva", email = "nslatysheva@gmail.com",
                  role = c("aut")))
Description: Infer the code style (which style rules are followed and which ones are 
    not) from one package and use it to check another. This makes it easier to
    find and correct the most important problems first.
